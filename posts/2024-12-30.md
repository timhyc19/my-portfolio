# Introduction
*January 1st, 2025*

Hellooo to anyone reading this! My name is Tim, and I’m a Korean-Canadian based in Toronto, Ontario. Just last month, I officially wrapped up my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo. As I transition out of student life and gear up for my first full-time role as a Member of Technical Staff (MTS) @ [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), I’ve decided to start a blog. I don't know how long this will go, but my short-term goal is to spend this winter break productively, document my journey, and share my reflections as I strive to grow into a better engineer.

This post is a relatively short reflection on my past four years at Waterloo, highlighting the lessons, challenges, and unforgettable memories that shaped my journey. Whether you're a student, a fellow engineer, or just curious about life at Waterloo, I hope you enjoy this glimpse into my experience!


# My Journey in Waterloo

### First Year: Online Beginnings
Starting university during the COVID-19 pandemic was far from what I had envisioned. My first two semesters were entirely remote, which meant virtual classes, assessments, and almost no in-person social interaction. It was a tough adjustment. I spent most of my time at home, tackling CS135 Racket assignments, working through Learn quizzes, and navigating my first co-op search. I found the math courses fairly doable because of the IB and AP math I had taken in high school; in contrast, I hadn't really programmed much up to that point, so I struggled through a lot of the CS content.

That initial co-op search was challenging. I applied to a mix of QA and data analytics roles and eventually landed an offer with a government division working on data science. Despite being remote, it turned out to be one of my most enjoyable co-ops! The project I worked on was fascinating, and I connected with some amazing colleagues. During this time, I also dived headfirst into gaming—playing Genshin Impact (I pulled Diluc on my first roll lol), Valorant, TFT, and League of Legends. Hopefully, my gaming arc end


### Second Year: Finding my Footing on Campus

When in-person classes resumed in my second year, it was both exciting and overwhelming. Navigating campus, meeting new people, and stepping out of my comfort zone wasn’t easy. Thankfully, many of my high school friends were also at Waterloo, which made the transition smoother. We formed a basketball intramural team and played regularly at PAC.

The toughest courses for me were definitely CS241 and CS251; trying to understand and memorize those MIPS/assembly commands was so painful. On the other hand, I really enjoyed CS240. I felt like it was one of the most useful courses in my undergrad (shoutout to Rob Hackman).

Inspired by my first co-op, I became more curious about data science and machine learning. I ambitiously updated my resume with a bunch of fancy ML algorithms (bruh), learned/practiced a bunch of SQL, and applied to various companies. I landed an internship at a nuclear-based energy company, where I worked on implementing machine learning into their financial sector. This was one of my more underwhelming experiences; the ML org was quite small, and it made me realize the importance of foundational software engineering principles and how machine learning cannot succeed without proper data infrastructure.


### Third Year: Building Momentum
My third year was probably the most eventful for me, particularly because, during these semesters, I felt I gained some valuable co-op experience, took lots of relevant computer science courses, and began honing my interview skills.

My third internship was as a data engineer at an accounting firm, where I got to work with clients to build out data pipelines for insurance tasks.

Most of my days comprised looking at long SQL queries and writing questionable code that triggered feelings of imposter syndrome. Nevertheless, I had a great team and ultimately felt I delivered on some high-impact projects!

During my study terms that year, I spent lots of time at DC, Maclab, and E7, studying for my courses and trying to meet new people. One of these terms, I took STAT 330, which was easily the most difficult course in my undergrad. Despite the course being very calculus-heavy (which was my strong suit), there were lots of theories and statistical concepts that were difficult to grasp (still don't know how I managed to pass the course).

My fourth internship was one of my favourites; I was a software engineer at an IoT company, focusing on data infrastructure. I got to work on lots of different data-driven services on GCP (mainly Airflow, Dataflow, Pub/Sub, etc.) and also did some CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

I also got to work remotely for one week, so my family decided to take a 48-hour road trip from Toronto to Vancouver. We stopped by Banff, Lake Louise, Jasper, Peyto Lake (image above), and more. Saw some amazing wildlife and ate lots of good food!

Towards the end of this internship, I had some random motivation to grind leetcode and prepare for my upcoming internships. I spent lots of hours looking through [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice) questions / videos. I spent on average 2-3 days on each pattern, sometimes more on the harder topics like DP and greedy.

### Fourth Year: Wrapping It All Up
My fourth year felt like the culmination of everything I had worked toward during my undergrad. It was a whirlwind of learning, working, and reflecting on what I wanted to do after graduation. I had two incredible internships during this time, both of which pushed me to grow as an engineer. I worked closely with the team handling data infrastructure for large language model (LLM) pretraining. This was my first deep dive into the workflows behind training LLMs, and it was absolutely fascinating. I focused on automating parts of the data pipeline and worked with tools like PySpark and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

I also got to work remotely in South Korea for two weeks—my first visit in over 11 years. The trip was surreal; I reconnected with family, met several of my dad’s colleagues, and explored Korea’s vibrant food scene. On weekends, I took trips to Japan and Jeju Island, where I visited lots of landmarks like the Cheonjiyeon Waterfall (pictured above). Looking back, this internship was my favourite because of the interesting projects, super-talented colleagues, and the fast-paced industry that kept me on my toes.

I went back to school to finish my last two semesters; feeling confident in my data engineering/SWE skills, I took more interest in ML theory and statistics. My favourite courses were definitely CS486 and CS480; I got to implement some classical ML algorithms while also learning more relevant content like Neural Networks, Transformers, CNNs, etc. I also participated in volleyball and soccer intramurals for the first time and tried to get back into the guitar.

# Conclusion

Now that I’ve officially graduated, I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for the past four years. They were filled with ups and downs, but each challenge and milestone helped shape who I am today. From struggling through CS135 in my first year to working on cutting-edge AI systems in my final co-op, the journey has been nothing short of transformative.

As I prepare to start my first full-time role at Cohere, I’m excited about what the future holds. I hope to keep learning, growing, and documenting my experiences along the way. Thank you for reading this post, and I hope you’ll join me on this journey!
