# Introduction
*December 30, 2024*

Hellooo to everyone reading this! My name is Tim, and I’m a Korean-Canadian based in Toronto, ON. Just this past month, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo. I’ve started this blog as a way to spend my winter break productively, and to document my learning journey as I strive to grow into a better engineer. 

Next week I’ll be starting my first FT role as a Member of Technical Staff (MTS) @ [Cohere](https://cohere.com/). As I enter a new chapter in my life, I wanted to take some time to reflect on my past four years, and give others insight into my experiences as a university student. 

# My Journey in Waterloo
Because of Covid, I completed my first two semesters remotely; that meant virtual classes, virtual assessments, and almost zero social interaction. This was definitely not how I expected university to begin; sitting at home, suffering through cs135 racket questions and learn quizzes. My first co-op search was pretty difficult; I applied to a mix of QA / data analytics roles, and got an offer at a government division, doing some data science work. Despite it also being remote, it was one of my more enjoyable co-ops; got to work on a really interesting project, and met some really cool people! I also spent a lot of my time playing video games like Genshin Impact missions (pulled Diluc on my first roll LOL), Valorant, TFT, League c:

As I transitioned into in-person classes in second year, it was difficult navigating through campus, making new friends, and getting out of my comfort zone. Despite this, I was glad a lot of my high school friends came to UW; I made a basketball intramurals team with some of them, played lots of ball at PAC, and continued my gaming arc. As internship season came along, I was very intrigued from my first co op on data science and machine learning; I naively threw all the fancy algorithms on my resume, landed lots of interviews at relatively small companies, and eventually ended up at a nuclear-based energy company. This experience was somewhat underwhelming; the lack of direction and infrastructure to implement ML in production highlighted the importance of foundational software engineering principles. I realized that before diving into advanced algorithms, having clean data and a strong engineering foundation was essential for success as an ML Engineer.

My third year was the most eventful for me, particularily because I took lots of relevant computer science courses and began honing my interview skills. I completed two internships, one as a data engineer at an accounting firm, and one as a software engineer at an IOT company, focusing on infrastructure / devops. I had great mentors across both these jobs, and
